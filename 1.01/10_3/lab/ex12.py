# Exercise 1.2. Write Python code to evaluate these expressions.
# The answers can be stored in a name, or evaluated in a print statement

# 1. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?

x = ((42 * 60) + 42)
print(x)

min = 42
sec = 42

totalsec = ((min * 60) + sec)
print(totalsec)


# 2. How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61
# kilometers in a mile.

kilometers = 10
miles = kilometers / 1.61
print(miles)


# 3. If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your
# average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average
# speed in miles per hour?
